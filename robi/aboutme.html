                         in the beautiful and strange country Germany.
                          To be precise in Augsburg (located in the south of Germany),
                           which has about 350’000 residents. I love this city very
                            much and it has everything what I need. Funfact: The water
                             in Augsburg is one of the best in Europe (source). Of course
                              I love anime, but I also have another love which might be
                               bigger than anime. Of course it’s not a girlfriend: It’s
                                the beautiful game. I’m supporting the FC Augsburg and
                                 here are some informations if you never heard of it: It’s
                                  a solid club which plays since 10 years in the Bundesliga
                                   and played 2016 in the UEL (knocked off against Liverpool lmao).
                                    Before the pandemic I used to go often to the stadium with friends.
                                     If you have interest talking with me about football just hit me up!</p></div>

                    <p>How I got really into Anime.. That’s a good question. 
                        Back when I was 9 years old I’ve watched very very much 
                        YouTube and somehow I saw the opening from Lucky Star.
                         Idk why but I really got interested in it (In general
                          I was very much interested about Japan), but I’ve never
                           watched it. Till May 2018. I had a very bad time for
                            months and I needed something positive and calm. So
                             I had the idea watching Lucky Star. It was something 
                             special for me since nobody else around me was watching anime.
                              So I got deeper in it and now I’m here with nearly 100 completed
                               anime(Ik for some of you it’s very less in two years but
                                I’m studying very much so I can’t watch very much lmao).
                                 I’d definitely say that anime changed my life and I’m proud about it.

                            If someone would ask me for my top 3 anime,
                             I wouldn’t have a clue. I still tried it and
                              it was very hard for me to decide since there
                               are many many which I really love. But still
                                have a look at it &lt;3! (Don’t except the biggest
                                 review you ever have read and there is no particular order)

                             the only reason why I like
                              Eru Chitanda so much. It’s
                               in general her character
                                and with how much passion she’s
                                 showing by solving mysteries with
                                  Oreki Houtarou. I just love the mix of him as an unmotivated
                                   as a “energy-saver” boy and her as a passionated and interested girl.
                                    The other main characters (Satoshi Fukube; “Database and Mayaka Ibara 
                                    (very strict) complete the quattro in the Classic Literature Club. As
                                     I mentioned before, they are solving mysteries from the School, but also
                                      personally ones. I’d say that I love the story and the characters, combined
                                       with the good animation by KyoAni you have a very beautiful and interesting
                                        anime. Sadly there probably won’t be a second season since the director (Yasuhiro Takemoto)
                                         died in the KyoAni-Fire in 2019. It’s pretty sad, but I think it’s better than releasing a second season which isn’t as great as the first..

                                         Give it a try, it’s very very heartwarming!

                        I’m not the biggest fan of classic music, but still the soundtrack is one of the reasons why I love Hibike! so much. The story is also pretty good: It’s about the main characters Kumiko Oumae, Reina Kousaka and her friends Sapphire Kawashima and Hazuki Katou, which all joined the high school brass band club in the Kitauji High School. Their goal is winning the national band competition and of course it isn’t easy. I really liked the story with the all different characters in the brass band club and KyoAni did a really good job in the animation which is very good (especially for 2015!).I’m really happy that the third season will probably published in 2021, but before watching it I’d recommend to watch the both movies (Liz to Aoi Tori and Hibike! Euphonium Movie: Chikai no Finale) after the second Season first.
                                     <br><br>
                                     I’d recommend Hibike! Euphonium to everyone who is interested in music and just watched K-on. And of course to everyone who loves KyoAni’s works!

                        A man has fallen into the river in Lego City in love into Kaguya Shinomiya in the Shuchiin Academy, but also a woman has fallen (still not) into the river in Lego City in love into Miyuki Shirogane. Both don’t want to confess their love, so they are “challenging” each other with the goal, that the other is confessing his/her love, while they are working in the student council. The other characters (Chika Fujiwara, Yuu Ishigami and soon Miko Iino) are also working in the student council and there are many funny events with and without them. So I’d say that Kaguya-sama is very much with comedy, but also with much love. What I also really like that there is much character development (especially by Kaguya) and it’s interesting to see how it changes the anime itself. The animation by A-1 Pictures is good, but you won’t die of it because it’s not by KyoAni. But I don’t think it need such an amazing animation because the focus is really in the story and in the characters. As you can see in the title, I think the narrator is the reason why Kaguya-sama is so popular apart of the story. He makes everything more funnier and small “conflicts” into a serious event!
                                     <br><br>
                                     I’d say in overall that Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen is an anime which is pure comedy and perfectly to watch if you are in a really bad mood and want to see a really interesting story about love!
